# Codecov Feedback Repo

### Talk to us about Codecov! 

[Issues are open](https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues) for two purposes: 

1.) Provide feedback or ask questions about Codecov

2.) For unpaid users with problems to receive input from the community and best effort support from Codecov team members.\*

### Want to see the code? Here are our core product repos:

- [**codecov-api**](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-api): Codecov’s API layer. This is a Django / Django Rest Framework application that services our front end and public REST API.
- [**worker**](https://github.com/codecov/worker): Codecov’s asynchronous task processing layer. This is a Python and Rust application that is primarily responsible for offline task execution, managing job queues, and so on.
- [**gazebo**](https://github.com/codecov/gazebo): Codecov’s React SPA front end. This is the front end application end users interact with on the app.codecov.io subdomain.
- [**shared**](https://github.com/codecov/shared): A collection of shared functions and classes that are used by both codecov-api and worker

### Want to run it locally? Start here:

- [**self-hosted**](https://github.com/codecov/self-hosted): A repository that allows users to bootstrap Codecov proof of concept and small volume installations.

   ```

3. Parse the JSON response to get the desired information.

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Common Tasks

#### Task 1: Setting Up a New Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```sh
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Initialize a new Git repository:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install <dependencies>
   ```

5. Create a new Django project:
   ```sh
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   cd myproject
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

#### Task 2: Adding a New Feature

1. Create a new branch for the feature:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

2. Implement the feature in your codebase.

3. Add and commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

4. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

5. Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.

### Code Snippets and Explanations

#### Snippet 1: Connecting to a Database

To connect to a PostgreSQL database in a Django project, add the following configuration to your `settings.py` file:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

Explanation: This configuration sets up a connection to a PostgreSQL database named `mydatabase` with the specified user credentials and host information.

#### Snippet 2: Creating a Django Model

To create a Django model, define a class that inherits from `models.Model` in your `models.py` file:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
}
```

Explanation: This code defines a model named `MyModel` with three fields: `name`, `description`, and `created_at`. The `name` field is a character field with a maximum length of 100 characters, the `description` field is a text field, and the `created_at` field is a datetime field that automatically sets the current date and time when a new record is created.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Server Not Starting

**Problem:** The server fails to start with an error message.

**Solution:**
1. Check the error message for specific details.
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
3. Verify that the database configuration is correct.
4. Check for any syntax errors in the code.

#### Issue 2: API Request Failing

**Problem:** The API request returns an error response.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the API token is correct and has the necessary permissions.
2. Check the API endpoint URL for any typos.
3. Ensure that the request headers are set correctly.
4. Review the API documentation for any changes or updates.
