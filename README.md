# Codecov Feedback Repo

Talk to us about Codecov! [Issues are open](https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues).

Want to see the code? Here are our core product repos:

- [**codecov-api**](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-api): Codecov’s API layer. This is a Django / Django Rest Framework application that services our front end and public REST API.
- [**worker**](https://github.com/codecov/worker): Codecov’s asynchronous task processing layer. This is a Python and Rust application that is primarily responsible for offline task execution, managing job queues, and so on.
- [**gazebo**](https://github.com/codecov/gazebo): Codecov’s React SPA front end. This is the front end application end users interact with on the app.codecov.io subdomain.
- [**shared**](https://github.com/codecov/shared): A collection of shared functions and classes that are used by both codecov-api and worker

Want to run it locally? Start here:

- [**self-hosted**](https://github.com/codecov/self-hosted): A repository that allows users to bootstrap Codecov proof of concept and small volume installations.
